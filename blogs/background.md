# Background

In this blog, I will share with you an overview of our project and how we came up with the idea.

The goal of our project is to create a trading strategy based on the inverse of Jim Cramer's stock recommendations. Jim Cramer is a well-known financial analyst and host of the CNBC show "Mad Money." He has a large following of retail investors who often follow his stock recommendations. At the mean time, he has been criticized for making incorrect or misleading stock market predictions. Some of his most notable bad predictions include:

1. Bear Stearns: In 2008, Cramer said that Bear Stearns was "fine" just days before the company collapsed and was sold to JPMorgan Chase for a fraction of its previous value.
2. Lehman Brothers: Also in 2008, Cramer predicted that Lehman Brothers would not go bankrupt, just weeks before the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
3. Apple: In 2012, Cramer predicted that Apple's stock price would continue to rise and that the company was a "buy" at $700 per share. However, the stock price later declined significantly, reaching a low of around $90 per share in 2016.
4. General Electric: In 2017, Cramer recommended that viewers buy shares of General Electric, stating that the company was "too cheap to ignore". However, the stock price continued to decline in the following years, and the company eventually cut its dividend and experienced significant financial difficulties.

Based on Jim Cramer's track record of poor predictions in the stock market, we assumed that taking an inverse approach to his recommendations could potentially lead to a profitable trading strategy.

To accomplish this, we decided to incorporate sentiment analysis into our strategy. We wanted to analyze the sentiment of Jim Cramer's recommendations and use that to inform our trades. We believe that sentiment analysis can help us better understand the emotional state of the market and make more informed trading decisions. After that, we went against his opinion and sentiment. For instance, if Cramer recommends buying a particular stock, weh would sell the stock instead. Conversely, if Cramer recommends selling a particular stock, we would buy the stock instead.

Throughout the development of our project, we faced a number of challenges and tried various techniques to improve our strategy. In the upcoming blogs, I will share with you our journey and the different approaches we took to create a successful trading strategy.
